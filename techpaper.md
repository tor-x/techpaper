## Introduction

Today, cryptocurrencies are primarily traded on centralized crypto exchanges
(CEX) where user funds are at risk to hackers and platform managers.
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow users to retain control of their funds as
trades are mediated by smart contracts on a blockchain. Unfortunately, today’s
DEXs are slow, hard to use, and are restricted to trades on a single blockchain.

TOR-X is complex solution that consists of a new blockchain that is made for
decentralized exchange that reduces user\`s risks and provides solution for
cross-chain exchange, leveraging a high performance cross-chain matching engine
to handle massive order volume and decentralized mechanism for cross-chain
exchange supporting more complex trading APIs and smart contracts. Developers
can create and deploy custom DApps for the TOR-X network utilizing advantages of
new technological solutions.

Many people do not use DEXs because they cannot trade with their national
currencies. TOR-X is the first DEX that will allow its clients to enter the
exchange with fiat currencies such as USD, powered by a global network of
accredited third parties that must be TOR-X node holders. Exchange services are
critical not just for users of cryptocurrencies, but also for many other
applications built upon blockchain technology.

TOR-X pretends to build ecosystem of web-based decentralized applications
(dApps) running across public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These
decentralized applications would be provided with tools to interact with, make
and validate transactions and send data and funds across chains. To achieve this
vision TOR-X is developing the first cross-chain engine and API that will be
seamlessly integrateable with most of existing solutions such as wallets,
browser extensions and payment gateways. Web applications can use this API to
collect payments for goods in any digital currency, make trades and transactions
across blockchains, and interact with smart contracts across blockchains. All of
this cross-chain functionality is powered and made possible by the TOR-X
cross-chain matching engine.

TOR-X is issuing 100 million tokens to fund development and TOR-X technology
mass adoption, of which 60 million will be sold to the public during several
stages of sale.

## The History of Blockchain Industry Development

### Blockchain 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0


In the year of 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto's famous paper pioneered the concept of
Bitcoin. In the 10 years since then, the blockchain industry has developed
rapidly. Compared with the underlying architecture of the internet and other
technologies such as loT, Al, and cloud computing, blockchain has had a very
short development cycle.

Over the past 10 years, the blockchain industry has made significant progress
not only in the 1.0 era, as represented by Bitcoin, but in the 2.0 era,
represented by Ethereum and Consortium blockchains. Especially since the first
half of 2017, the explosion of ICOs based on a new fundraising method created by
Ethereum has stimulated a blockchain bubble and has also enabled more funds and
entrepreneurs to enter the business, accelerating industry development.

From July 2017 to June 2018, the total number of blockchain projects entering
the market, and total market capitalization, have reached 181.6% of the total
historical value of previous years. In the past year, the blockchain industry
has received unprecedented attention.

![Number of projects launched](https://tor-x.network/whitepaper/number-of-projects-1.jpg)

The new breakthroughs and opportunities that will exist in the 3.0 era as the
blockchain industry enters a stage of rapid development has become the most
discussed topic in the industry. The industry has interpreted the concept of
blockchain 3.0, in many different ways, and no unified standard has been
reached.

### Blockchain development: technology and economy


Starting from two core dimensions which drive blockchain industry - technology
and economy - by reviewing blockchain history and studying its key development,
this document defines sidechain & cross-chain technologies as important
representatives of blockchain 3.0, further crypto currency industry and concept
development.

![Blockchain Evolution](https://tor-x.network/whitepaper/blockchain-evolution-1.jpg)

Blockchain technology innovation mainly involves enhancing its functions and
performance. In 1.0 era, as a trusted distributed ledger, the Bitcoin system
could only implement functions such as bitcoin transfers, and with single digit
TPS. In the 2.0 era, Ethereum has applied smart contracts, supported operation
of Turing-complete scripts, and supported a variety of business logic and
commercial applications, greatly enriching blockchain functions. Consortium and
public blockchains with DPoS achieved even higher transaction performance.

In 3.0 era, sidechain & cross-chain technologies will play a key role in
expanding blockchain functions and performance.

Economic innovation mainly deals with the trading friction of digital and real
assets, and production relation innovations based on new asset allocation
methods. Between the 1.0 and 2.0 eras, a large amount of blockchain digital
assets were created. Reducing the transaction friction between assets, and
building a wider range of value networks and economic systems, both
fundamentally depend on the development of cross chain technology.

### Weaknesses and Threats of CEX approach


The Problem Blockchain technology and subsequent cryptocurrencies are so new
that many crippling challenges exist across trading platforms and exchanges.
Currently, digital currencies do not connect to each other in the same way that
information networks do. The current exchange model for currencies has a
critical barrier to linking small-scale currencies to other popular currencies
using a market-determined exchange rate. Also, the exchanges and trading
platforms are in essence acting as a centralized system that inherently brings
associated faults and defeats the purpose of decentralization. Challenges facing
crypto-exchanges and trading platforms today:

-   Centralization - owners and team became central entity censor that can
    prevent people from accessing exchange and liquidity that is against
    blockchain ideology. They set own rules, fees, control private keys to
    users\` wallets. That situation gives exchange full custodial rights of the
    funds.

-   Centralized exchanges operate out of blockchain - there are no ability to
    find out were orders actually put and taken, was it made by real market
    player or by exchange itself pursuing only aim to achieve higher rank in
    liquidity chart.

-   Centralized Exchanges fake trading volume that was disclosed by many
    independent researches that shown CEX manipulating their volumes to attract
    ratings, media hype and real liquidity from non-professional market players.

-   Barriers to Entry: There are different rules to join each platform, delays
    in approval, traditional currency deposits vs. digital only deposits, lack
    of instant deposits.

-   Challenges of Use: Trades blocked without explanation, daily limits, poor
    UI, buggy software, not user-friendly.

-   Latency: Incessant lack of speed and performance issues.

-   Lack of Support: There is a complete lack of customer support and inability
    to respond across most big-name platforms; It is not uncommon to wait weeks
    or months for a reply.

-   Lack of Security: Multiple hacks, lost funds, privacy breaches, shut down
    sites.

-   Lack of Privacy: Required verification, credit card, driver’s license scans,
    passports.

-   Exchanges being hacked and only users loose their funds but not exchanges.

Since very appearance of centralized token exchanges they became perfect aim for
hackers and different fraudulent activities. The only person who takes financial
risks and loses funds is client. Just imagine that customers of exchanges lost
more than 1,3 Bln USD. But if we calculate losses on current date this number
will multiply significantly. For example, Mt. Gox that was attacked in 2014 lost
744,408 BTC of customers\` funds. It is more than 4.6 Bln USD today.

It could never happen with approach that is offered by TOR-X team.

## TOR-X blockchain


TOR-X ecosystem will utilize best practices and approaches of blockchain
industry that were achieved during till present moment. Obviously, this is not
the best idea - to start a promising revolutionary project on a deliberately
outdated technology stack and consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work or Proof
of Stake.

In TOR-X we are going to solve following problems:

1.  Reasonable practical transaction per second (TPS) rate that will satisfy
    community demand.

2.  Support public and private blockchain segments where it will be reasonable.
    For example, all TOR-X DEX iDApp transactions must be public and easy to
    validate but TOR-X OTC market history could be placed on private blockchain
    segment.

3.  Smart contract and DApp, iDApp development accessible for the global
    developers community.

4.  TOR-X node and super node title redistribution will be controlled by
    Multi-Criteria Decision Making Neural Network itself without invasion from
    outside so it will be candid and final. This mechanism is required to
    prevent various attacks and manipulations with blockchain data.

5.  Node rating evaluation will be partially based on following incomplete list
    of factors:

    1.  TOR-X token holding Volume – the more TOR-X tokens being staked on
        node\`s contract, the higher rating will be assigned

    2.  TOR-X token holding Duration – the longer TOR-X tokens being staked on
        node\`s contract, the higher rating will be assigned

    3.  TOR-X node Performance KPIs – the higher TOR-X node\`s performance and
        network connection speed, latency, the higher rating will be assigned

    4.  TOR-X node Trust level – the more users rated p2p transaction through
        this node as positive, the higher rating will be assigned

Summarizing mentioned above, TOR-X team focusing on utilizing following stack of
algorithms and technologies:

1.  Hashgraph combined with Proof of History consensus algorithm.

2.  Gossip protocol for the purpose of quick and efficient consensus
    achievement.

3.  Self-learning Neural Network to solve problem of Multi-Criteria Decision
    Making, for example, TOR-X node status.

### TOR-X blockchain ecosystem


TOR-X blockchain ecosystem will cover all the interested communities:

1.  Developers that will enjoy clear and self-describing blockchain API and
    smart contract source code and developer bounty program.

2.  Traders that will be able to perform operations quickly and securely via
    built-in decentralized exchange engine on low latency and high capacity
    network with ability of adjustment transaction fees.

3.  Organizations that will be able to use single payment gateway to accept most
    of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, issue own tokens for the purposes of
    crowdfunding, loyalty programs, voting and in-app mechanics.

![TOR-X Blockchain Ecosystem](https://tor-x.network/whitepaper/structure-1.jpg)

### TOR-X iDApps


TOR-X ecosystem approach based on simple concept: every function of the
blockchain must be performed by separate single-task optimized iDApp that can be
developed either by TOR-X team or community developers. Every iDApp will have
fee structure that will cover: iDApp developer bounty, TOR-X team audit costs,
Miner bounty. This approach going to prevent appearance of malicious
applications and suspicious activity from one side and stimulate creative
developers to invent and deploy useful DApps and iDApps from another side.

![Revenue share model of TOR-X DEX iDAPP](https://tor-x.network/whitepaper/idapp-revshare-1.jpg)

### TOR-X DEX iDApp vision:


TOR-X team vision of iDApp is to focus on building of machine learning
algorithms instead of pre-coded business logic: TOR-X DEX iDApp will adjust
miners\` reward percentage based on current ecosystem state and iDApp load and
performance instead of a fixed reward fees. TOR-X Intelligent Decentralized
Application engine will support load balancing in accordance with network
segment time of the day and historical data. Moreover, TOR-X DEX iDApp will use
side blockchains instead of relying on single TOR-X blockchain only, for
example, during cross-chain exchange. TOR-X DEX iDApp can either deploy itself
on existing public blockchain such as Ethereum blockchain or rely on TOR-X
blockchain computing infrastructure. No matter anymore will it be Public or
Private blockchain. TOR-X DEX iDApp will choose the best available outcome to
outsource its computing infrastructure requirements. iDApp will only care about
the customers\` requirements that it serves since this would maximize everyone’s
revenue. For example, if the customers require privacy for OTC exchange, TOR DEX
iDApp would never utilize the Public blockchain since doing so would result in
losing all of its clients and income or cause significant price fluctuations.

1.  Decentralized exchange application has no access to users\` private keys,
    funds and sensitive personal data. All operations with users\` funds must be
    approved by themselves.

2.  Traders on TOR-X DEX can start trading immediately without needing to submit
    their name or any identifying documents of any kind. TOR-X DEX is not bound
    by intrusive, ineffective and pointless KYC/AML regulations that intrude on
    users\` privacy and which put them at risk of identity theft by making the
    exchange a target for hackers.

3.  Crypto to fiat and fiat to crypto exchange supported by global network of
    TOR-X nodes and super nodes that stake TOR-X tokens as security deposit to
    cover default risks.

4.  Seamless cross-chain exchange via single entry point. All exchange
    operations are made via TOR-X token. TOR-X neural network will be used for
    matching of exchange orders.

5.  Any crypto-asset exchange process will be accessible with any device and any
    operating system.

There are several stages of TOR-X token unlock that will take place after ICO
and before TOR-X Mainnet launch.

1.  Upon TOR-X exchange listing, TOR-X team going to distribute Sale, Pre-Sale 
and Private Sale tokens excluding bonus share.

2.  The next unlock stages will take place in 3 months and 6 months after
 listing

3.  Tokens for Team and advisors will be locked for 1 Year and 2 years in
    accordance with plan.This is necessary measure for the purpose of prevention
    of TOR-X Token price dump.

## Forecast of TOR-X token price


Based on our experience, market dynamics and ultimate and unbeatable advantages
of stack of technologies that will be used by TOR-X team to build TOR-X
blockchain ecosystem and services, we made forecast of TOR-X token price
dynamics for the two years’ perspective after TOR-X ICO hardcap reach and in
accordance with TOR-X Network project roadmap.

![TOR-X  token to USD price forecast](https://tor-x.network/whitepaper/price-forecast-1.jpg)

## TOR-X Masternode and Node holders’ benefits

TOR-X Network architecture uses nodes and masternodes to support network with
computing power, blockchain replication and DApps operation. Both nodes and
masternodes are paid a portion of block rewards. Each block reward consists of
transaction rewards that were computed in this block. Payment of reward will be
made in TOR-X network native tokens. That payment serves as a form of passive
income to nodes and masternodes owners.

As TOR-X masternodes and nodes title redistribution will be performed by MCDM
Neural Network, we decided to simplify this process.

TOR-X token holder that are willing to support network and become node or
masternaode maintainer will have to stock TOR-X token collateral. Initial
amounts of token staking are:

-   20 000 TOR-X tokens for obtaining node title

-   100000 TOR-X tokens for obtaining masternode title.

In case if there are will be more than 20% of token holders pretending to
maintain node and/or masternode, other parameters such as performance, uptime,
connection speed, geographical location will be taken into account.

### Masternodes – top 4% of TOR-X holders


Masternodes are reputable parties that are holding stack of TOR-X tokens, with
significant community outreach and established trust in the industry, such as
foundations, alliances, venture funds and etc. As a reward for the validation
services and distributed ledger hashing and synchronization, masternodes get the
following advantages:

-   Higher percentage of TOR-X DEX iDApp commission fees.

-   Periodical voting-free token/coin listing opportunity. Listing procedure is
    kept closed first (only super nodes acting as a due diligence gate to filter
    out the best projects) for the sake of maintaining high-volume pairs, but it
    will be delegated to the community with voting being in place once the
    volume and the user base are acquired.

-   Perform secure OTC cross-chain deals with lower commissions.

-   Perform and act as escrow in crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto pEp exchanges 
where it will be requested by users.

### Voting tokenized nodes - top 4% to 20% of TOR-X holders


Node owners are parties that are holding significantly less volumes of TOR-X
tokens than masternode owners. Nodes owners will have following advantages:

-   Operate as relays of network and ledger replication keepers.

-   Measure and aggregate blockchain health state data for Self-learning Neural 
Network that is working on Multi-Criteria Decision Making task.

-   Lower share of TOR-X DEX iDApp commission fees.

-   Initiation of voting for token/coin listing.

-   Ability to become Masternode once staked enough tokens to get into top 4% of
 holders

## TOR-X Node voting mechanism


TOR-X node, super node title redistribution mechanism is one of the most complex
tasks that has to be solved by TOR-X Team as this task plays key role in
profitability distribution of TOR-X Node holders and reduction of fees for TOR-X
network users.

To solve this problem in a most efficient and impartial way TOR-X team performed
research of different Multi Criterial Decision Making algorithms and spatial
modeling of voting choice.

Historical transaction data of TOR-X iDApps in conjunction with results of
spatial modeling of electoral choice of TOR-X users will provide ability to
determine potentially fraudulent actions of network participants to prevent them
and make TOR-X network safe for all market players.

	Let`s assume nodes as τ_1,τ_2 and τ_1<τ_2. 

In accordance with the theory of spatial modeling of electoral choice, TOR-X
network participant node preference with his perfect point β will have following
election preference:

	Node τ_1, in case if β<(τ_1+τ_2)/2
	Node τ_2, in case if β>(τ_1+τ_2)/2

We assume that voting subject evaluates his utility variation during the
sequence of equivalent periods. If the estimation of utility variation was
positive or non-negative than subject of TOR-X network will vote for incumbent;
otherwise subject will give his vote for challenger. So, if K(t) is utility
value at the moment t, and elections take place at integer times i.e. t=1,2,3,…, 
than voting subject will vote:

	For incumbent in case if K(t)≥K(t-1)
	For challenger in case if K(t)≤K(t-1)


As there are different set of factors that has influence on node voting process,
there is only way to use stochastic model:

	p(β_i,K_i,(t))=exp[-α(β_i-(K_i (t))/(K_i (t-1)) * (τ_1+ τ_2)/2)]/(1+exp[-α(β_i-(K_i (t))/(K_i (t-1)) * (τ_1+ τ_2)/2)] )

In this equation $$\alpha$$ –parameter describes how quickly changes probability
as you move to the left and to the right of the point of voting

	β=(K_i (t))/(K_i (t-1))  (τ_1+ τ_2)/2,where p(β_i,K_i,(t))=0

So the less value of $$\alpha$$ –parameter, the greater role of stochastic, that
means higher role of factors that were not taken into account during model
creation in comparison with economical factors that were mentioned in model.

## TOR-X ecosystem application scenarios


The public chain project represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum has shown us the
great potential of the blockchain, but due to the intrinsic technical
characteristics of the blockchain, single-chain solutions are restricted by the
performance and transaction speed. There has been a lack of revolutionary
breakthroughs in the latter. TOR-X Network infrastructure will bring new
solutions:

### Decentralized cross-chain crypto currency exchange iDApp

The main aim of TOR-X team is to build secure DEX iDApp. Decentralized trading
has long been constrained by cross-chain technology, and current decentralized
trading only allows for transaction on the same public chain. TOR-X network will
provide infrastructure for TOR-X DEX iDApp. TOR-X DEX will become secure,
decentralized and auditable cross-chain trading platform and liquidity provider
for the global blockchain community.

### Two-way crypto-2-fiat and fiat-2-crypto exchange

This is one of the main purposes of TOR-X ecosystem – provide global
p2p(person-to-person) and pEp(person-Escrow-person) exchange gateway. This
significant advantage of TOR-X ecosystem that became cornerstone of crypto
economics mass adoption.

### Decentralized Applications

TOR-X Network developers team will provide support, development environment 
and tools to community of DApp developers. This will help to grow community 
of TOR-X Ecosystem and will make development process easy and convenient. 
The main accelerating factor of TOR-X mass adoption will be commission sharing 
scheme between DApp developers, node owners and TOR-X team.

### Two-way cross-chain exchange 

Two-way cross-chain exchange use of the same assets across chains and extended
application scenarios. With cross-chain exchange, assets on one chain can be
transferred to other chains. New blockchain systems can greatly enhance
technical features and application scenarios for assets. Not only can
responsibility for transactions on the main chain be shared, saving storage,
computation, and network resources on the main chain, and preventing transaction
congestion, but also the value of the original tokens is not damaged.

## TOR-X marketplace


TOR-X marketplace is a space where service and goods providers will be able to
meet customers. All transactions of marketplace will be made through TOR-X token
and prices in other tokens and currencies will be provided for reference only.
This mechanism will involve TOR-X exchange and fiat2crypto/crypto2fiat TOR-X
network gateways. This approach will stimulate global demand for products,
services and native token – TOR-X coin that will become primary medium of
exchange in TOR-X ecosystem
